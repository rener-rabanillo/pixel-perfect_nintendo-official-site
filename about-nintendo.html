      <h1>History</h1>

      <div>
        <h2>Beginnings (1889-1929)</h2>
        <p>
          Fusajiro Yamauchi founded Nintendo as Nintendo Koppai in Kyoto, Japan, as a hanafuda playing card manufacturer, and were sold in dedicated
          Nintendo stores in Kyoto and Osaka. This achievement led Nintendo to become the first Japanese company to find success in manufacturing and
          selling western-style playing cards.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in 1929, Fusajiro Yamauchi retired and left the company to his son-in-law, Sekiryo Kaneda.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>New successor (1929-1949)</h2>
        <p>
          In his tenure, Kaneda set up a joint partnership company named Yamauchi Nintendo & Co., modernizing operations and transforming Nintendo into a
          special partnership company. A separate distribution company for the range of Western playing cards was set up, named Marufuku Co. Ltd.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1949, he passed away and Fusajiro&apos;s great-grandson, Hiroshi Yamauchi, took over the company.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Venturing into the video game world (1949-2002)</h2>
        <p>
          Initially, Nintendo was still focused on producing hanafuda playing cards well into the 20th century, but Yamauchi sought to expand the business
          beyond playing cards. During the 1950s and 1960s, he experimented with various industries, including toys, instant rice, and even love hotels,
          though many of these ventures failed. But success came when Nintendo ventured into toys and later, the rising video game industry. Under his
          leadership, the company produced groundbreaking games such as Donkey Kong, Super Mario Bros. and consoles including the Super Famicom in 1983 and
          the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2002, he stepped down as president of the company and handed the reins to Satoru Iwata.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>A new era (2002-2015)</h2>
        <p>
          Under his Iwata&apos;s tenure, Nintendo achieved groundbreaking success with the Nintendo Wii and the 3DS, significantly expanding the gaming
          audience. Known for his hands-on approach as he was a former video game programmer and developer, he was deeply involved in game development and
          famously worked on titles like Pokémon Gold and Silver to troubleshoot programming issues. Iwata&apos;s philosophy of "games for everyone" and his
          approachable demeanor made him beloved by fans and colleagues alike.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Into the Future (2018-Present)</h2>
        <p>
          Since then, Nintendo has continued to build on his legacy, embracing innovation and creativity to remain a dominant force in the video game industry.
          The launch of the Nintendo Switch in 2017 revolutionized the industry by combining handheld and home console gaming capabilities. Its versatility
          and expansive library of games, including major franchises like The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario, and Animal Crossing, have made it one of the
          best-selling consoles of all time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nintendo has also embraced digital gaming with the Nintendo eShop, allowing players to access classic titles, indie games, and new releases
          seamlessly. Today, Nintendo continues to balance innovation and imagination with their iconic titles and consoles, providing fun and entertainment
          for all ages alike.
